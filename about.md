## The origins of Manuel
Born and bred in the Italian countryside. He lived in a tiny village (less than 1500 people) surrounded by vineyards for most of his life. He studied accounting before realising that his place was not at a desk filling in forms for double entry bookkeeping.

He thus shifted to computer engineering (and business administration), graduating from the University of Trento, Italy, and later studied artificial intelligence and cognitive science at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK. At Sussex, he also completed a PhD in informatics and artificial intelligence, under the supervision of [Chris Buckley](https://christopherlbuckley.com/), working on ideas of variational free energy minimisation and active inference as models of sensorimotor loops in the context of embodied and enactive cognitive science.

Following his PhD, he collaborated with Chris, [Anil Seth](https://www.anilseth.com/) and [Warrick Roseboom](http://www.warrickroseboom.com/) on the application of active inference to robotics (Chris) and modelling of responses in psychophysics (Anil and Warrick). In November 2019, Manuel is joining RIKEN CBS, Tokyo, Japan, to work with [Taro Toyoizumi](http://toyoizumilab.brain.riken.jp/) on models of uncertainty for human behaviour and perception.

Manuel is overall interested in any formal, ideally mathematical, definition of (or attempt to define) life and cognition. Specifically in questions regarding the differences between living and non-living systems, and cognitive and non-cognitive architectures. Are these distinctions meaningful? What theories can we develop to highlight such diversity? If there's no real distintion, why do some organisms appear to be qualitatively different?

These interests are inevitably tied to the definition of agents and observers, with ideas partially inspired by autopoietic proposals in theoretical biology and cognitive science. What can be defined as a *system*, or an agent, to be studied? How can we ensure that an observer's (a scientist's) influence on a system is not drastically changing its behaviour?


## The origins of life
Manuel worked for a short period at [EON](http://eon.elsi.jp/) (ELSI Origins of life Network) at Tokyo Tech. There, he worked on theories of the origins of life (Ool), with a special interest for proposals attempting to link Ool to information and control theory. Is homeostasis a good explanation of the difference between living and non-living systems? Does control theory provide the right set of tools to study homeostasis? Can information theory be used to define a useful (intrinsic) notion of information for living systems? For a brief overview: [blogpost for EON](http://eon.elsi.jp/information-and-regulation-at-the-origins-of-life/). In his spare time: trying to figure out what life is all about.

## The origins of cognition
Manuel is interested in (minimal) models of cognition. Where does it come from and why is it potentially (evolutionarily) advantegeous? His approach mainly entails trying to link basic definitions of cognitive processes, in particular action and perception, to simple mathematical models of sensorimotor loops in the context of coupled agent-environment systems. During his PhD, he focused on a mix of information theoretic and dynamical systems derived approaches, combining ideas of uncertainty inherent in information and estimation theory, with an understanding of time-evolving trajectories and phase spaces in dynamical systems. Somewhat unsure about (but attracted by the idea of) a life-mind continuity thesis.
