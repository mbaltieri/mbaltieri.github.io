## Hybrid life
### Organisers: Manuel Baltieri, Hiroyuki Iizuka, Keisuke Suzuki, Olaf Witkowski, Lana Sinapayen
#### ALIFE conference - special session
The main focus of artificial life (ALife) research is the study of natural systems with the goal of understanding what life is. More concretely, ALife defines ways to investigate processes that contribute to the formation and proliferation of living organisms. In 2018, we introduced a new special session as part of the ALIFE annual conferences, Hybrid Life. Our goal is to look at traditional Alife topics, and beyond, from three different *hybrid* perspectives:

- unified formal languages for an *overall description* of living, as well as artificial and cognitive systems, e.g. control theory, Bayesian inference, dynamical systems theory, etc.
- an understanding of biological systems enhanced by artificial components (or artificial systems augmented with organic parts) in order to investigate the *moving boundaries* between living and nonliving organisms, and including work from bio-inspired robotics, human augmentation, synthetic biology, etc.
- a study of coupled heterogenious (biological-artificial) systems that can shed light on the importance of interactions among different types of systems, such as in the fields of human- or animal-computer interaction, virtual and augmented reality systems, etc.
