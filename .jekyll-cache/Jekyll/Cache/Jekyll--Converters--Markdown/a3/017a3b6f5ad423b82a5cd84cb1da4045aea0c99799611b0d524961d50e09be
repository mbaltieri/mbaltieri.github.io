I"ö<p>Thank you for buying the PRO version of Hydejack! ðŸŽ‰</p>

<p>More than one year ago I was looking for a blogging platform but couldnâ€™t find it:
One that would let me write posts in markdown with my own editor,
one that didnâ€™t look awful buy modern design standards, and one that felt snappy on a mobile phone.
That and more is now Hydejack. I hope you enjoy it <a href="https://qwtel.com/">as much as I do</a>.</p>

<h2 id="first-steps">First Steps</h2>
<p>Start by reading the <a href="/docs/" class="heading flip-title">Documentation</a>.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:</p>

<ul class="related-posts faded">
  <li><a href="/docs/install/" class="heading flip-title">Install</a> â€” How to install and run Hydejack.</li>
  <li><a href="/docs/config/" class="heading flip-title">Config</a> â€” Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.</li>
</ul>

<p>After youâ€™ve familiarized yourself with Hydejack, you can delete the following folders and files
containing example content:</p>
