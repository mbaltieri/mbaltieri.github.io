This page contains a list of selected presentations that Manuel gave over the years, with PDFs and recordings shared whenever possible[^1]. Please feel free to reference the material contained here, and leave a comment if you'd like.

Minor updates have been implemented whenever necessary (missing references, typos, etc.) but the contents have largely been left unchanged. While all of the material is based on some of Manuel's previous work, bear in mind that his opinion and thoughts might have changed (following some at least approximate sequence of Bayesian inference steps) over time.

[^1]: In some cases sharing was/is not allowed, (but do expect more PDFs over time). Sometimes a (virtually) identical presentation was given in multiple occasions so no PDFs will be included, this is especially true for presentations with the same title.
