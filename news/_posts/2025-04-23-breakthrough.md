## Talk at Breakthrough Discuss

Manuel was invited to give a talk on April 23rd for an [event](https://breakthroughinitiatives.org/initiative/5) organised by [Breakthrough Initiatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakthrough_Initiatives), launched by Yuri Milner and Stephen Hawking and currently chaired by Pete Wordenled.
He introduced some of his recent on agency as a "relative" of a definition of life, or rather as one of its precursors, based on material he taught at a winter school in Sapporo in 2023, see this [blogpost]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link news/_posts/2023-01-08-winter-school-agency.md %}), slides can be found [here](/assets/pdf/presentations/BreakthroughInitiatives2025.pdf) and the recording [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wuzt7JgRuM).
