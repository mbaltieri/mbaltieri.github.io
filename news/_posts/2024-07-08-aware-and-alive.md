## Talk at TAIS 2024
Manuel was accepted to give a talk at the [Aware and Alive workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/awareandalive/home?authuser=0) organised by Keisuke Suzuki and Katsunori Miyahara at [CHAIN](http://chain.hokudai.ac.jp/), Hokkaido University.

The talk focused on a "behavioural" account of predictive coding, focusing on a coalgebraic treatment of generative model (for an agent) and generative process (for an environment) as coalgebras and their relation instantiated by an optimal predictive coding agent instantiated as a bisimulation.

Presentation material (PDFs and recordings) available in the ["Presentations" page](/research/presentations).
