## Talk at TAIS 2024
[AI Safety Tokyo](https://aisafety.tokyo) organised the second conference on AI Safety in Japan in 2024, the Technical AI Safety Conference [(TAIS)](https://tais2024.cc).

On April 6th, Manuel gave a talk based on the role ALife could play in AI safety search, with references to the work on Markov/Friston blankets, see this [blogpost]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/2021-01-09-friston-blankets.md %}), and their limitations as a motivating example for this research agenda.
