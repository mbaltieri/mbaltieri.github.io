## Seminar at Unified theory of prediction and action meeting

Manuel was invited to give a seminar on May 30th for a [meeting]https://unifiedtheory.jp/en/meeting5/) organised by the Unified theory of prediction and action group, led by Takuya Isomura.
He briefly introduced some of his recent work on predictive coding seen through the lenses of coalgebras, slides can be found [here](/assets/pdf/presentations/UnifiedTheory2025.pdf).
