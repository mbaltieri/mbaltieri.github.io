## Talk at Consciousness Club Tokyo
The [Consciousness Club](https://conscious-machine.org/club/) invites speakers to discuss topics related to consciousness, relating to questions such as: "What are the neural and computational bases of consciousness? What is the mathematical structure of our conscious perception? Can machines ever become conscious?".

In July, Manuel was invited (host, Hiro Hamada) to give a talk about the recent work on Markov blankets and the free energy principle, see this [blogpost]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/2021-01-09-friston-blankets.md %}), recorded and publicly available on [Youtube - "Infernece with and within a model"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ascyxuJ6lIk&t=1s&ab_channel=ConsciousnessClubTokyo).
