## Co-organising ALIFE 2023
### ALIFE 2025 - Cyphers of Life
#### Kyoto - Japan, 6th-10th October 2025.

Manuel will be a Co-organiser of [ALIFE 2025](https://2025.alife.org) - Cyphers of Life, following his role in [ALIFE 2023]({% link news/_posts/2023-03-01-alife-2023.md %}) - Ghost in the machine, and [ALIFE 2022]({% link news/_posts/2022-03-01-alife-2022.md %}) - La DOLCE Vita.

This yearâ€™s theme is Ciphers of Life, encouraging participants to explore the many ways that life encodes information, creates internal languages, and interacts in encrypted ways with its environment. Artificial life research focuses on understanding, replicating, and extending the fundamental principles of life. Much of this research involves creating artificial systems that exhibit life-like behaviors.

Classically, these endeavors are divided into three categories: Hardware research, wetware research, and software research. At ALIFE 2025 conference, the newest research in all three categories will be featured alongside artistic expressions, industry vendors, public events, and more.
